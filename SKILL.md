description: Supports compliance with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689). Use when the user needs to classify an AI system under the AI Act risk categories (prohibited, high-risk, limited, minimal, GPAI), check provider or deployer obligations for high-risk systems, evaluate GPAI model obligations including systemic risk thresholds, verify transparency obligations under Article 50, or run a fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) under Article 27. Target users are AI system providers, deployers, importers, distributors, EU consultants on AI compliance, and engineers building AI products for the EU market.

# AI Act Compliance

EU Regulation 2024/1689 — practical compliance support for AI providers, deployers, and consultants.

## When to use this skill

Use when someone needs to:

- Classify an AI system or model under the AI Act (in scope? prohibited? high-risk? limited risk? minimal? GPAI? GPAI with systemic risk?)
- Identify the role(s) the organisation plays (provider, deployer, importer, distributor)
- Check obligations applicable to a high-risk system as **provider** (Articles 8–22)
- Check obligations applicable to a high-risk system as **deployer** (Articles 26–27, including FRIA)
- Check obligations applicable to a **GPAI model** provider (Articles 51–55)
- Verify **transparency obligations** under Article 50 (chatbots, synthetic content, emotion recognition, biometric categorisation, deepfakes)
- Map applicable **dates of application** for the specific system or role

**Do not use** when the user asks for:

- Legal advice on a specific case (this needs an EU AI lawyer with case-specific knowledge)
- Pre-existing legal opinions on national implementation in a specific Member State (rules will be added by national supervisory authorities; not yet finalised in many countries as of 2026)
- Drafting of EU-AI-Act-conformity declarations (CE marking) — the skill structures the documentation but does not produce the final signed document
- Compliance with sector-specific regimes that interact with the AI Act (e.g., Medical Devices Regulation, automotive type-approval) — these need dedicated skills

## Disclaimer

This skill is a support tool for compliance work, not a substitute for qualified legal or technical counsel. The AI Act is recent legislation with phased application (most obligations between 2 February 2025 and 2 August 2027) and the harmonised standards under preparation by CEN-CENELEC JTC 21 are not yet published. **Outputs require review by competent counsel and, for high-risk systems, by a notified body where applicable.** Penalties under Article 99 reach EUR 35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover for prohibited-practice violations.

## Sub-tasks

Based on the user's request, load the relevant task file:

- **System classification**: user asks "is my system in scope? what category? am I a provider or deployer?" — read [`tasks/classify-system.md`](tasks/classify-system.md). **Always start here unless classification is already established.**
- **Prohibited practices check**: user wants to verify no Article 5 prohibition is triggered — read [`tasks/check-prohibited-practices.md`](tasks/check-prohibited-practices.md)
- **High-risk provider obligations**: classified high-risk + role is provider — read [`tasks/check-high-risk-provider.md`](tasks/check-high-risk-provider.md)
- **High-risk deployer obligations**: classified high-risk + role is deployer (incl. FRIA) — read [`tasks/check-deployer-obligations.md`](tasks/check-deployer-obligations.md)
- **GPAI provider obligations**: providing a general-purpose AI model — read [`tasks/check-gpai-provider.md`](tasks/check-gpai-provider.md)
- **Transparency obligations (Article 50)**: any AI system interacting with humans / generating synthetic content — read [`tasks/check-transparency.md`](tasks/check-transparency.md)

If the request is generic ("help me with the AI Act"), start with classification.

## General process

1. Identify the user's role(s) and system(s).
2. Run classification first (`classify-system.md`) unless explicitly stated.
3. Based on classification, route to the relevant obligations task.
4. For each obligation, capture: applicable? met? gap analysis? remediation steps?
5. Always include applicable dates of application (the AI Act phases obligations; some rules already in force, others up to August 2027).
6. Conclude with the appropriate disclaimer and a call to legal review.

## Limits

This skill does NOT:

- Replace legal counsel or notified body conformity assessment.
- Produce signed conformity declarations or CE marking documentation ready for submission.
- Cover Member State-specific national implementing measures (e.g., national AI authorities' guidance, where relevant).
- Cover sector regimes interacting with the AI Act (medical devices, automotive type-approval, financial services AI use cases under existing sectoral regulation).
- Track post-2026 jurisprudence and Commission delegated/implementing acts in real time — the user must verify the date of last update of `references/sources.yaml`.
- Replicate the EU Commission's official Compliance Checker at the AI Act Service Desk (<https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/>) — for authoritative self-assessment, use that tool.

**Every output requires review by qualified counsel before adoption or filing.**
